3. Scaling or scalability.

It is the ability of an application or a system to increase or decrease the performance or cost, as per the requirements.

4. Infrastructure.

IT Infrastructure is made up of hardware and software, just an example of a Data Centre, that is hosted remotely, and there, we manage all the hardware stuff, networks, and operating systems with the help of the internet. It’s quite hard to manage the infrastructure manually, a lot of manual effort is required to maintain it. Cost expenditure increased on the failure of the physical memory board, network switches etc.

Nowadays, it’s quite easy to manage the infrastructure with Cloud providers like #Azure, #AWS, and #GCP. We don’t need to purchase the hardware; we just use the services and Pay as per the “Per-As-You-Go” model with the help of stable internet.
